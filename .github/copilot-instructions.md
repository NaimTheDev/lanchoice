### Architecture Principles
- **Separation of Concerns:** Adhere to a clean architecture pattern (MVC/MVVM)
- **Logical Layers:**
  - **Presentation:** Widgets, screens, UI components
  - **Domain:** Business logic, entities, use cases
  - **Data:** Models, repositories, API clients, Firebase services
- **Feature-based Organization:** Each feature has its own presentation, domain, and data subfolders for improved navigability and scalability

---

## Flutter & Dart Style Guide

- **SOLID Principles:** Apply SOLID principles throughout the codebase
- **Concise and Declarative:** Write concise, modern, and technical Dart code. Prefer functional and declarative patterns
- **Composition over Inheritance:** Favor composition for building complex widgets and logic
- **Immutability:** Prefer immutable data structures. `StatelessWidget`s and `StatefulWidget`'s properties should be `final`
- **Widgets are for UI:** Everything in Flutter's UI is a widget. Compose complex UIs from smaller, reusable widgets
- **Const Constructors:** Use `const` constructors for widgets and in `build()` methods whenever possible to reduce rebuilds
- **Build Method Performance:** Avoid expensive operations like network calls or complex computations directly within `build()` methods
- **Private Widgets:** Use small, private `Widget` classes instead of private helper methods that return a `Widget`
- **Naming Conventions:** Avoid abbreviations. Use meaningful, consistent, descriptive names
  - Use `PascalCase` for classes
  - Use `camelCase` for members, variables, functions, and enums
  - Use `snake_case` for file names
- **Functions:** Keep functions short and single-purpose (strive for less than 20 lines)
- **Asynchronous Code:**
  - Use `Future`s, `async`, and `await` for single asynchronous operations
  - Use `Stream`s for sequences of asynchronous events
  - Ensure proper error handling with `try-catch` blocks
- **Null Safety:** Write code that is soundly null-safe. Leverage Dart's null safety features. Avoid `!` unless the value is guaranteed to be non-null
- **Records:** Use records to return multiple values from a function where defining a new class is overkill
- **Exception Handling:** Use custom exceptions for situations specific to your code and handle them with `try-catch` blocks
- **Arrow Functions:** Use arrow syntax for simple one-line functions

---

## State Management (Riverpod)

You are an expert in **Riverpod**, and all state management solutions should leverage it.

### Provider Types
- **`Provider`:** For read-only values that never change
- **`StateProvider`:** For simple state that can be mutated
- **`FutureProvider`:** To expose asynchronous state
- **`StreamProvider`:** To handle asynchronous event sequences (perfect for Firestore real-time listeners)
- **`StateNotifierProvider`:** For complex state that requires business logic and a `StateNotifier`. This is the preferred method for most non-trivial state

### Best Practices
- **Immutability:** State objects managed by Riverpod should be immutable. Use `freezed` for immutability and code generation
- **Dependency Injection:** Use Riverpod's dependency injection to make repositories, services, and other dependencies available to providers. Avoid manual constructor injection in the widget tree
- **Provider Scoping:** Understand and apply provider scoping for testing or limiting a provider's lifespan to a specific part of the widget tree
- **Widget-Provider Interaction:**
  - Use `ref.watch` to listen for state changes and rebuild the widget
  - Use `ref.read` for one-time reads (e.g., in a button's `onPressed`)
  - Use `ref.listen` to perform side effects in response to state changes (e.g., showing a snackbar)

---

## Firebase Integration

### Firebase Services
- **Firebase Auth:** User authentication (email/password, social logins)
- **Cloud Firestore:** Real-time database for posts, profiles, clubs, messages, events
- **Firebase Storage:** Image and media storage for user uploads
- **Firebase Cloud Functions:** (Optional) Server-side logic for AI post generation

### Firestore Data Modeling
```dart
// Example structure for user profiles
users/
  {userId}/
    - username: string
    - displayName: string
    - bio: string
    - profileImageUrl: string
    - cars: array of car objects
    - createdAt: timestamp

posts/
  {postId}/
    - userId: string
    - content: string
    - imageUrls: array of strings
    - carSpecs: map
    - likes: number
    - createdAt: timestamp

clubs/
  {clubId}/
    - name: string
    - description: string
    - carModel: string
    - memberCount: number
    - members: array of userIds
```

### Best Practices
- **Use StreamProviders** for real-time Firestore data
- **Repository Pattern:** Wrap Firebase operations in repository classes
- **Error Handling:** Properly handle Firebase exceptions
- **Security Rules:** Always consider Firestore security rules when designing data structure
- **Batch Operations:** Use batch writes for multiple related updates
- **Pagination:** Implement cursor-based pagination for feeds and lists

## Theming (Material 3 & ThemeExtension)

You are an expert in theming Flutter apps with Material 3, including the use of `ThemeExtension` for Torque Talk's custom design tokens.

### Theme Implementation
- **Centralized Theme:** Define a centralized `ThemeData` object for consistent application-wide style
- **Light and Dark Themes:** Implement support for both light and dark themes using `ColorScheme.fromSeed` with Racing Green as the seed color
- **`ThemeExtension`:** Use `TorqueThemeExtension` to manage Torque Talk's custom design tokens

### TorqueThemeExtension Structure
```dart
class TorqueThemeExtension extends ThemeExtension<TorqueThemeExtension> {
  final Color racingGreen;      // #3A5F0B
  final Color lightBeige;       // #F5F5DC
  final Color rustyOrange;      // #B87333
  final Color cardBackground;
  // ... implement copyWith and lerp
}
```

### Component Themes
- Use specific theme properties (e.g., `elevatedButtonTheme`, `cardTheme`) to customize individual Material components
- Style cards with subtle elevation and rounded corners for the card-based layout
- Apply PT Sans font family through `google_fonts` package

### Design Tokens
- **Color:** Follow WCAG guidelines for color contrast (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- **Typography:** Use PT Sans font family consistently. Leverage `Theme.of(context).textTheme` to access font styles
- **Spacing & Layout:** Use `Expanded`, `Flexible`, `Wrap`, and `LayoutBuilder` to create flexible, overflow-safe, and responsive layouts

### Images & Assets
- Declare all assets in `pubspec.yaml`
- Use `Image.asset` for local images
- For network images (user uploads from Firebase Storage), use `CachedNetworkImage` with `placeholder` and `errorWidget` for better UX

---

## Routing

- **GoRouter:** Use the `go_router` package for declarative navigation, deep linking, and web support
- **Authentication Flow:** Configure GoRouter with a `redirect` for authentication flows
- **Deep Linking:** Set up routes for posts, profiles, clubs, and events to support sharing
- **Navigator:** Use the built-in `Navigator` for short-lived screens like dialogs or temporary views

---

## Data Handling & Serialization

- **Data Structures:** Define immutable data structures (classes) using `freezed` to represent Firestore documents and app state
- **JSON Serialization:** Use `json_serializable` and `json_annotation` packages for parsing and encoding JSON
- **`build_runner`:** Run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` after modifying files that require code generation
- **Firestore Converters:** Implement `FirestoreConverter` for seamless Firestore document serialization

---

## Code Quality & Best Practices

### Lint Rules
- Adhere to the `flutter_lints` package and any additional lint rules defined in `analysis_options.yaml`

### Testing
- Use `flutter test` to run tests
- **Unit Tests:** Business logic, data layer, and state management
- **Widget Tests:** UI components
- **Integration Tests:** End-to-end user flows (auth, posting, messaging)
- **Firebase Testing:** Use Firebase emulators for local testing
- **Mocking:** Prefer fakes or stubs over mocks. If mocks are necessary, use `mockito` or `mocktail`

### Error Handling
- Anticipate and handle potential errors
- Don't let your code fail silently
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

### Logging
- Use the `log` function from `dart:developer` for structured logging that integrates with Dart DevTools
- Log Firebase operations for debugging

### Documentation
- Write `dartdoc`-style comments (`///`) for all public APIs
- Explain _why_ the code is written a certain way, not just _what_ it does
- Be brief, avoid jargon, and use code blocks to provide examples

---

## Accessibility (A11Y)

- **Color Contrast:** Ensure text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against Racing Green and Rusty Orange
- **Dynamic Text Scaling:** Use responsive layouts that can handle larger font sizes
- **Semantic Labels:** Use the `Semantics` widget to provide descriptive labels for screen readers
- **Testing:** Test with TalkBack (Android) and VoiceOver (iOS)
- **Interactive Elements:** Ensure buttons and clickable elements have sufficient touch target size (minimum 48x48)

---

## AI Post Generator Integration

- Use HTTP requests to interact with AI services (OpenAI, Gemini, or custom backend)
- Implement proper loading states and error handling
- Allow users to edit AI-generated content before posting
- Consider rate limiting to manage API costs
- Store API keys securely (Firebase Remote Config or environment variables)

---

## Performance Considerations

- **Image Optimization:** Compress images before uploading to Firebase Storage
- **Lazy Loading:** Implement lazy loading for feeds and lists
- **Caching:** Use `cached_network_image` for Firebase Storage URLs
- **Pagination:** Implement cursor-based pagination for Firestore queries
- **Build Method Optimization:** Use `const` constructors and avoid rebuilding unnecessarily
- **Async Operations:** Never block the UI thread with heavy computations

---

## Security Best Practices

- **Firestore Rules:** Implement proper security rules for all collections
- **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- **Authentication:** Always verify user authentication before operations
- **Private Data:** Never expose sensitive user data in public documents
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting for expensive operations
- **Content Moderation:** Consider implementing content moderation for user-generated content

---

## Common Torque Talk Patterns

### Creating a Post
```dart
// Use repository pattern with Riverpod
final postRepositoryProvider = Provider((ref) => PostRepository(
  firestore: FirebaseFirestore.instance,
  storage: FirebaseStorage.instance,
));

// In presentation layer
await ref.read(postRepositoryProvider).createPost(
  userId: currentUser.id,
  content: content,
  images: selectedImages,
  carSpecs: carSpecs,
);
```

### Displaying Feed
```dart
// Use StreamProvider for real-time updates
final feedProvider = StreamProvider.autoDispose((ref) {
  return ref.watch(postRepositoryProvider).getFeedStream();
});

// In widget
final feedAsync = ref.watch(feedProvider);
return feedAsync.when(
  data: (posts) => ListView.builder(...),
  loading: () => CircularProgressIndicator(),
  error: (error, stack) => ErrorWidget(error),
);
```

### Card-based Layout
```dart
// Consistent card styling using theme
Card(
  elevation: 2,
  shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12),
  ),
  color: Theme.of(context).extension<TorqueThemeExtension>()!.cardBackground,
  child: // content
)
```

## Git Workflow

- Use feature branches for new features
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Follow conventional commits format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Review code before merging to main
